- View demo
- Generate prompt functionality
- Analysis focus selection
- Front-end frameworks logo integration

3. State Management:
- The application uses a component-based state management strategy with React.js components.
- Data is managed in components, with props passed between components as needed.

4. Routes:
- The application has the following routes:
  - Home
  - About
  - Contact
  - Instruction
  - Upload Image
  - Generate Prompt (when *Choose analysis focus: Desktop applications* is selected)

5. Component Architecture:

  - 📚 "Instruction" component (parent)
    - 🔗 "Downloads" (children)
    - 🚚 "Recipe Guide" (children)
    - 📚 "About" component (parent)
    - 📞 "Contact Us" (children)

1. Responsive Breakpoints:
- The application uses media queries to switch between two and three column grid layouts on desktop and mobile screens, respectively. The media queries are:
  - @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    // Code for 3-column layout
  }
  - @media screen and (max-width: 767px) {
    // Code for 2-column layout
  }
